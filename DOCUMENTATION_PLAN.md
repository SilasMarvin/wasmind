# Comprehensive Documentation Plan for Hive

## Current State Analysis

**Existing Documentation:**
- **Actors**: Excellent READMEs (Assistant, Delegation Network, Tool Actors) - comprehensive and well-structured
- **Configuration**: Excellent README in `hive_config` - very detailed with examples and troubleshooting
- **Missing**: READMEs for 7/9 core crates in `/crates/`
- **Missing**: Overall project README, getting started guide, developer documentation

**What's Missing:**
- Main project README.md 
- Core crate READMEs (hive, hive_actor_loader, hive_actor_utils, etc.)
- MDBook documentation structure
- Getting started guides
- Developer onboarding

## Documentation Strategy

### Phase 1: Complete README Coverage
**Crate READMEs to Create (with distinct purposes):**

1. **`/README.md`** (Main Project)
   - Project overview and mission
   - Quick start (install CLI, basic usage)
   - Link to book for comprehensive docs
   - Repository structure overview

2. **`crates/hive/README.md`** (Core Library)
   - The main Hive system library
   - API overview for library users
   - Core concepts (actors, messages, coordination)
   - Link to book for detailed usage

3. **`crates/hive_cli/README.md`** (CLI Tool)  
   - CLI installation and basic usage
   - Command reference
   - Configuration file setup
   - Link to book for advanced usage

4. **`crates/hive_actor_loader/README.md`** (Actor Loading)
   - Actor loading and dependency resolution system
   - Used by library developers
   - Architecture explanation

5. **`crates/hive_actor_utils/README.md`** (Actor Development)
   - Utilities and macros for actor development
   - How to build actors
   - Message patterns and tools

6. **`crates/hive_llm_types/README.md`** (LLM Integration)
   - LLM type definitions and chat message handling
   - Integration patterns

7. **Update `crates/hive_actor_bindings/README.md`** (currently minimal)
   - WASM bindings for actor communication
   - Technical details for actor developers

### Phase 2: MDBook Structure
**Book Focus: Hive System (not CLI-focused)**

```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **10 content pages total** - focused and manageable
- **Clear audience separation** - user guide for using Hive, developer guide for extending it
- **Concepts page** covers shared foundational knowledge both audiences need
- **Examples in context** - each guide has its own relevant examples
- **Reference under developer guide** - technical documentation for those building with Hive

## Content Strategy

### READMEs vs Book Content
**READMEs**: 
- Technical reference for specific crates/actors
- API documentation
- Quick start for developers using that specific component
- Build/test instructions

**Book**: 
- Learning paths for users and developers
- Conceptual understanding
- Practical examples and workflows
- How components work together

### Key Principles
1. **No Duplication**: Each document has a clear purpose and authority
2. **Strategic Linking**: READMEs and book cross-reference appropriately
3. **Audience Focus**: READMEs for component users, book for system users/developers

### Authoritative Sources
- **Configuration details**: `hive_config/README.md` (book links to it)
- **Actor specifics**: Individual actor READMEs (book provides overview + links)
- **System concepts**: Book's concepts.md page
- **Usage patterns**: Book's examples in each guide

### CLI Positioning
- CLI is introduced in user guide as the primary interface
- Not the focus - just the current way to interact with Hive
- Developer guide mentions embedding as alternative

## Implementation Priorities

**High Priority (Phase 1):**
1. Main project README
2. Core crate READMEs (hive, hive_cli, hive_actor_utils)
3. MDBook structure setup

**Medium Priority (Phase 2):**
4. Getting started guide in book
5. Developer guide foundation
6. User guide with config integration  

**Lower Priority (Phase 3):**
7. Advanced topics and examples
8. Reference documentation
9. Remaining utility crate READMEs

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1 Tasks
- [ ] Main project README.md
- [ ] crates/hive/README.md (core library)
- [ ] crates/hive_cli/README.md
- [ ] crates/hive_actor_utils/README.md
- [ ] crates/hive_actor_loader/README.md
- [ ] crates/hive_llm_types/README.md
- [ ] Update crates/hive_actor_bindings/README.md
- [ ] Setup MDBook structure

### Phase 2 Tasks
- [ ] Setup MDBook structure (book.toml, SUMMARY.md)
- [ ] Write introduction.md
- [ ] Write concepts.md (agents, actors, messages, scope, coordination)
- [ ] User guide pages (5 pages)
  - [ ] user-guide/README.md
  - [ ] user-guide/getting-started.md
  - [ ] user-guide/configuration.md
  - [ ] user-guide/using-actors.md
  - [ ] user-guide/examples.md
- [ ] Developer guide pages (7 pages)
  - [ ] developer-guide/README.md
  - [ ] developer-guide/building-actors.md
  - [ ] developer-guide/message-patterns.md
  - [ ] developer-guide/tool-actors.md
  - [ ] developer-guide/testing.md
  - [ ] developer-guide/examples.md
  - [ ] developer-guide/reference.md

### Phase 3 Tasks
- [ ] Polish and cross-linking between book and READMEs
- [ ] Add more examples based on user feedback
- [ ] Consider additional pages if gaps are identified

This creates a cohesive documentation ecosystem where READMEs serve as quick reference and entry points, while the book provides comprehensive learning paths for different user types.
