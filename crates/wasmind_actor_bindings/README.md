# Wasmind Actor Bindings

WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) definitions for Wasmind actor communication. This crate contains the interface specifications that define how actors interact with the Wasmind system and each other.

No Rust is exported from this crate! It is designed to be included as a component dependency. Add the following lines to your Cargo.toml:

```
[package.metadata.component.target.dependencies]
"Wasmind:actor" = "0.1" 
```

You can then import these interfaces in your WIT definition. E.G:

```
world your-world {
  import Wasmind:actor/host-info@0.1.0;
  import Wasmind:actor/messaging@0.1.0;
  import Wasmind:actor/http@0.1.0;
  import Wasmind:actor/logger@0.1.0;

  ... your exports
}
```

See the entire interface in `wit/world.wit`

## Interface Overview

The WIT definitions specify how actors:
- Receive and handle messages via `handle-message`
- Access system capabilities (HTTP, commands, spawning)
