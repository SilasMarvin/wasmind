# Wasmind LLM Types

Type definitions and utilities for Large Language Model integration in Wasmind actors. This crate provides standardized types for chat messages, tool calls, and LLM API interactions.

The types are designed to be used with [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/).

[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/wasmind_llm_types/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/wasmind_llm_types)
