# Wasmind Actor Utils Macros

Procedural macros for building Rust actors in the Wasmind actor system. This crate provides code generation utilities that simplify actor development.

[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/Wasmind_actor_utils_macros/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/Wasmind_actor_utils_macros)

These macros are re-exported through [`Wasmind_actor_utils`](../Wasmind_actor_utils/) for convenient access when building actors.
