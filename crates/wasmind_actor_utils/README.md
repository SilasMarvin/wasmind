# Wasmind Actor Utilities

Utilities and types for building Rust based Wasmind actors. This crate provides the building blocks that actor developers need: message types, tool abstractions, and development macros.

It is not required to use the traits, macros, etc... in this crate to build actors. This are simply utilites that simplify actor development.
