# Hive LLM Types

Type definitions and utilities for Large Language Model integration in Hive actors. This crate provides standardized types for chat messages, tool calls, and LLM API interactions.

The types are designed to be used with [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/).

[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/hive_llm_types/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/hive_llm_types)

These types are used throughout the Hive actor ecosystem for consistent LLM integration.
