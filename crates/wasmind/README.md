# Wasmind Core Library

The main orchestration library for Wasmind's actor-based system. This crate provides the runtime and coordination primitives for loading and managing WebAssembly actor components.

## What This Crate Does

The Wasmind core library handles:
- **Actor Loading**: Dynamically loads WASM actor components and manages their lifecycle
- **Message Orchestration**: Routes messages between actors using broadcast channels
- **Scope Management**: Organizes actors into hierarchical scopes for coordination
- **System Coordination**: Manages actor readiness, spawning, and shutdown across the entire system

This is a library crate for building applications - for conceptual understanding of actors, scopes, and message passing, see the [Wasmind Book](https://silasmarvin.github.io/wasmind/concepts.html).
