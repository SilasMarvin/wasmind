# Examples

The best way to learn is by exploring complete, working examples.

## Example Configurations

The Wasmind repository includes several example configurations that demonstrate different use cases and patterns. These examples show real-world setups you can use as starting points for your own configurations.

**ðŸ‘‰ [Browse Example Configurations](../../../../crates/wasmind_cli/example_configs/)**

Each example includes:
- Complete TOML configuration files
- Actor dependencies and overrides
- LiteLLM model setup
- TUI customizations
- Detailed explanations of what each setup demonstrates

## Using the Examples

To try an example configuration:

1. **Copy the configuration** to your local directory
3. **Set your API keys** in environment variables
4. **Run with wasmind_cli**:
   ```bash
   wasmind_cli -c your-example.toml
   ```
