# Testing

## Unit Testing

You can test your actor logic using standard Rust testing:

```bash
cargo test
```

Write unit tests for your actor's business logic, message parsing, and utility functions as you would with any Rust project.

## Integration Testing

We're exploring options for an integration testing framework to test actor message flows and multi-actor interactions.

## More Coming Soon

Additional testing strategies and tools will be added as the testing framework evolves.
